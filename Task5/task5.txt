1. Improving Error Handling in the loginUser Function
The current error handling in the loginUser function is too generic. To provide more specific error responses to the client, we can improve the function by:

a. Creating custom error types: Differentiating errors like "User Not Found" and "Invalid Password" so that clients know what went wrong.
b. Returning proper HTTP status codes: Using different status codes (e.g., 404 for "User Not Found", 401 for "Invalid Password").
c. Logging errors: Ensure server-side errors are logged for debugging without exposing internal details to the client.
d. Handling operational vs. programming errors: Operational errors (e.g., wrong credentials) should be handled gracefully, while programming 
errors (e.g., missing variables) should trigger alerts.


class AuthenticationError extends Error {
  constructor(message, statusCode) {
    super(message);
    this.name = 'AuthenticationError';
    this.statusCode = statusCode;
  }
}

async function loginUser(email, password) {
  try {
    // Find user by email
    const user = await findUserByEmail(email);
    
    if (!user) {
      // Throw specific error for user not found
      throw new AuthenticationError('User not found', 404);
    }

    // Verify password
    const isPasswordValid = await verifyPassword(user, password);
    
    if (!isPasswordValid) {
      // Throw specific error for invalid password
      throw new AuthenticationError('Invalid password', 401);
    }

    // If successful, return success response
    return { success: true, user };

  } catch (error) {
    // Log the error (important for internal tracking)
    console.error(`Error during login: ${error.message}`);

    // If error is an instance of AuthenticationError, send specific error response
    if (error instanceof AuthenticationError) {
      return { success: false, message: error.message, statusCode: error.statusCode };
    }

    // Handle unexpected errors (e.g., database failures)
    return { success: false, message: 'An unexpected error occurred', statusCode: 500 };
  }
}

Improvements:

1.Custom AuthenticationError Class: We define an error class that allows us to differentiate between different types of authentication-related errors and include an appropriate status code.
S2.pecific Error Messages: We now return specific errors like "User not found" and "Invalid password", with their respective HTTP status codes (404 for not found, 401 for unauthorized access).
L3.ogging: All errors are logged for internal tracking, which helps developers debug and monitor issues.
4.Generic Fallback for Unexpected Errors: If an unexpected error occurs (e.g., a database connection failure), a generic response with a status code 500 is returned.



2. Importance of Differentiating Between Different Types of Errors
Why is it important to differentiate between errors (e.g., user not found vs. invalid password)?

1. Better User Experience:
 -User-Specific Feedback: Providing users with clear, actionable feedback (like "User not found" or "Invalid password") helps them understand the exact issue and take corrective action, like checking their email or resetting their password.
 -Prevent Frustration: Generic error messages can frustrate users, as they don’t indicate whether the problem is with the credentials or the account itself.
2. Security Concerns:
-Minimizing Information Exposure: While it’s important to give meaningful feedback, care should be taken not to expose sensitive details (e.g., whether the user exists or not). This is a security consideration. Some applications may choose to return a more generic message like "Invalid credentials" to avoid exposing which part of the login failed.
-Distinguishing Invalid Password vs. User Not Found: In some cases, differentiating between "Invalid password" and "User not found" is acceptable when balanced with security concerns, especially in environments where providing this information is not a risk.
3. Error Tracking and Debugging:
-Operational Errors: Differentiating between types of errors (e.g., "User not found" vs. "Database connection failed") allows the development team to monitor and address operational issues more effectively.
-System Alerts: If the issue is operational (e.g., a failed database connection), that should trigger alerts for system administrators, whereas user errors (like invalid passwords) are expected and don’t require intervention.
4. Appropriate HTTP Status Codes:
-Client-side Awareness: Returning the correct HTTP status codes (e.g., 404 for "User not found" and 401 for "Unauthorized" when the password is wrong) allows clients and other applications consuming the API to handle these errors appropriately.
-Correct Error Response: APIs need to adhere to REST standards and provide proper status codes to signal different types of errors, improving interoperability with other services.
